# Todoey-iOS-Exercise
An exercise I learned in Udemy. It is a Todo list app that allows users to create a list of categories and todos under them. The main takeaway here was the use of color gradients as the list progresses. It also enables the user to search through todos using the search bar feature.

# What I learned
- CoreData
- RealmSwift as an alternative to CoreData as a relational database
- Using Chameleon Framework to figure our color combinations
